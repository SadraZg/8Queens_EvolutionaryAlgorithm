# 8 QUEENS

This is an assignment for one of my university courses "Computational Intelligence".

Implemented with Analytical and Backtracking algorithms and also my own implementation of Genetic algorithm

-   By executing each file, the total time of execution will be written in a .txt file.
-   These times will be used in chart.py file to make the bar chart.

-   In BackTracking.py we have implemented a memory profiler to profile the memory complexity
    it would do the same for other files but since it prints the hole profile line-by-line, I
    didn't use it in them.

    NOTE that it has been tested in each file and results are as following:

    -   Depending on input size(number of queens) the time complexity differs.
    -   on the other hand, there isn't a big difference in memory usage.
    -   You can see each algorithm's total_elapsed_time in it's own output file.
        They are as same as the ones written in log file to use for chart creation.

- At last, by executing the chart.py file, you can see the bar chart of elapsed time of each algorithm
